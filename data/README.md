# Data 

This directory stores project datasets and reference files used by pysics. It is organized into the following subfolders:

- materials/  
  Material property databases, such as density, elastic constants, thermal properties, optical constants, etc. Use open, citation-friendly formats (CSV, JSON, YAML). Include source and units in file headers/metadata.

- spectra/  
  Spectroscopic data (e.g., absorption/emission spectra, reflectance, Raman/IR, XRD patterns). Prefer columnar text formats (CSV/TSV) with metadata file or header block describing instrument, conditions, units, and preprocessing steps.

- reference/  
  General reference data used by models or examples (constants, calibration curves, lookup tables).
