# pysics — A Comprehensive Physics Library in Python

**pysics** is a pure Python library designed to provide an extensive collection of physical constants, equations, and formulae. It serves as a valuable toolkit for students, researchers, educators, and developers, offering support for a wide range of physics domains — from classical mechanics to quantum theory.

## Key Features

- **Extensive Constants Database**  
  Includes all major physical constants — SI base units, quantum constants, astronomical values, and more.

- **Modular Formula Collections**  
  Organized modules covering mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, atomic physics, nuclear physics, and beyond.

- **Unit Conversion Utilities**  
  Easily convert between unit systems such as SI, CGS, and natural units.

- **Built for Education and Research**  
  Designed to integrate seamlessly into scientific calculators, simulations, teaching tools, or research codebases.

## Installation
