pysics - A Comprehensive Physics Library in Python

pysics is a pure Python library that provides an extensive collection of physical constants, equations, and formulae for students, researchers, educators, and developers. It supports a wide range of physics domains — from classical mechanics to quantum physics — allowing for quick calculations, simulations, and scientific tool development.

Features

All Major Constants: From SI base constants to quantum and astronomical units

Formula Modules: Mechanics, thermodynamics, electromagnetism, atomic physics, nuclear physics, and more

Unit Conversion Utilities: Easily switch between SI, CGS, natural units, and others

Designed for Education and Research: Easy to integrate into educational tools, calculators, and simulations

Installation (Coming Soon)

Once published:
``` bash
    pip install pysics
```
