# Computational 

This module provides core tools and techniques from computational science used to solve complex mathematical problems numerically. It is useful for applications in physics, engineering, data science, and applied mathematics.

## Structure

### `__init__.py`
Initializes the `computational` module for easy import.

### `finite_elements.py`
Implements the **Finite Element Method (FEM)** for numerically solving partial differential equations in physical systems and engineering.

### `monte_carlo.py`
Provides **Monte Carlo methods** for stochastic simulations, numerical integration, and modeling randomness in complex systems.

### `numerical_methods.py`
Contains general **numerical algorithms**, including:
- Root-finding methods (e.g., Newton-Raphson)
- Numerical differentiation and integration
- Interpolation and approximation techniques

### `optimization.py`
Includes **optimization techniques** such as:
- Gradient descent
