# Solid State 

This module provides implementations and concepts from solid-state physics, covering the structure and behavior of crystalline materials, their electronic and magnetic properties, and collective excitations.  

## Structure  

- **`__init__.py`**  
  Initializes the solidstate package for import.  

- **`crystal_structure.py`**  
  Covers crystal lattices, Bravais lattices, unit cells, and symmetry.  

- **`electronic.py`**  
  Implements models of electronic structure, band theory, and conductivity.  

- **`magnetic.py`**  
  Contains concepts of magnetism in solids including paramagnetism, ferromagnetism, and antiferromagnetism.  

- **`phonons.py`**  
  Describes lattice vibrations, phonon dispersion, and their role in thermal properties.  

- **`superconductivity.py`**  
  Covers superconducting states, Cooper pairs, and key theoretical models.
