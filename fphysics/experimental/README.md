# Experimental Module

The `experimental` package provides a set of tools for performing, analyzing, and managing experimental data. It is designed for scientists, engineers, and researchers who want to streamline data collection, analysis, and error evaluation.

## Structure

The package is organized into the following modules:

- **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the `experimental` package.  
- **`data_analysis.py`**: Contains functions and classes for processing and analyzing experimental data.  
- **`error_analysis.py`**: Provides methods for calculating uncertainties, propagating errors, and performing statistical error analysis.  
- **`instrumentation.py`**: Utilities and interfaces for managing instruments and recording measurements.  
- **`measurement.py`**: Functions for performing measurements, storing results, and handling experimental datasets.
