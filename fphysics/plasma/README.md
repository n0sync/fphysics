# Plasma Physics

This branch provides a collection of formulas for calculating fundamental plasma properties, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) quantities, wave dispersion relations, and kinetic theory functions.

## Structure

The toolkit is organized into modular components:

- **`__init__.py`**: Initializes the plasma physics package.
- **`basic.py`**: Core plasma parameters such as plasma frequency, Debye length, and plasma beta.
- **`kinetic.py`**: Kinetic theory and distribution functions including Maxwellian distributions, Landau damping, and Coulomb collisions.
- **`magnetohydrodynamics.py`**: Magnetohydrodynamic quantities including Alfvén speed, magnetic pressure, magnetic Reynolds number, and generalized Ohm's law.
- **`waves.py`**: Dispersion relations for various plasma waves including Langmuir, ion-acoustic, Alfvén, cyclotron harmonics, and magnetosonic waves.
