# Examples Module

This branch provides ready-to-use examples demonstrating how to apply the library's functions across different domains of physics.

## Structure
- **mechanics_examples.py** – Example problems in classical mechanics.
- **quantum_examples.py** – Demonstrations of quantum mechanics concepts.
- **thermodynamics_examples.py** – Sample calculations and simulations in thermodynamics.
- **visualization_examples.py** – Plotting and visual representation of physical phenomena.

These examples serve as practical guides for learning, testing, and exploring the library's capabilities.
