# Relativity

This module provides implementations and concepts from Einstein’s theory of relativity, covering both special and general relativity, the structure of spacetime, and cosmological applications.  

## Structure  

- **`__init__.py`**  
  Initializes the relativity package for import.  

- **`special.py`**  
  Covers Special Relativity: Lorentz transformations, time dilation, length contraction, and relativistic dynamics.  

- **`general.py`**  
  Implements General Relativity: Einstein’s field equations, spacetime curvature, geodesics, and black hole metrics.  

- **`spacetime.py`**  
  Provides tools for describing Minkowski and curved spacetimes, including metric tensors, intervals, and causal structure.  

- **`cosmology.py`**  
  Explores cosmological models: FLRW metric, expansion of the universe, Hubble’s law, and dark energy.
