# Solutions

This module provides implementations and concepts from theoretical and computational physics, focusing on the behavior of systems at atomic, molecular, and statistical levels, as well as operator methods and field-theoretic approaches.  

## Structure  

- **`__init__.py`**  
  Initializes the solutions package for import.  

- **`atomic.py`**  
  Covers atomic models, energy levels, spectra, and electron configurations.  

- **`molecular.py`**  
  Implements molecular structure, bonding, vibrational/rotational spectra, and electronic transitions.  

- **`field_theory.py`**  
  Provides concepts of classical and quantum field theory, including Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formulations.  

- **`operators.py`**  
  Describes operator methods in quantum mechanics, commutation relations, eigenvalue problems, and observables.  

- **`statistical.py`**  
  Covers statistical mechanics: ensembles, partition functions, thermodynamic quantities, and fluctuations.
