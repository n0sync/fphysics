# Statistical Mechanics

This module provides implementations and concepts from statistical mechanics, focusing on the microscopic foundations of thermodynamics, probability distributions, partition functions, and collective phenomena in physical systems.  

## Structure  

- **`__init__.py`**  
  Initializes the statistical_mechanics package for import.  

- **`distributions.py`**  
  Covers probability distributions in statistical mechanics, including Maxwell-Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and Bose-Einstein.  

- **`partition_functions.py`**  
  Implements canonical, grand canonical, and microcanonical partition functions and their thermodynamic consequences.  

- **`quantum_statistics.py`**  
  Explores quantum statistical mechanics, quantum gases, and phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation.  

- **`critical_phenomena.py`**  
  Describes phase transitions, scaling laws, universality, and renormalization group concepts.
