# Oscillations

This module provides implementations and concepts related to oscillatory motion and wave phenomena, covering simple harmonic motion, coupled systems, acoustics, and vibrations.  

## Structure  

- **`__init__.py`**  
  Initializes the oscillations package for import.  

- **`shm.py`**  
  Covers simple harmonic motion, including equations of motion, energy relations, and damped/forced oscillations.  

- **`coupled_oscillators.py`**  
  Implements coupled oscillator systems, normal modes, and resonance phenomena.  

- **`acoustics.py`**  
  Describes sound waves, resonance in air columns, Doppler effect, and acoustic intensity.  

- **`vibrations.py`**  
  Focuses on mechanical vibrations, damping, resonance curves, and quality factors.  

- **`wave_oscillation.py`**  
  Explores wave motion and oscillations in continuous media, including wave equations, interference, and standing waves.
