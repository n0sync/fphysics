# Electromagnetism Module

This branch of the library provides computational tools, formulas, and models
for classical electromagnetism, covering electric fields, magnetic fields, 
wave propagation, and optical phenomena.

## Structure

- **`__init__.py`** – Initializes the module and provides easy access to submodules.
- **`circuits.py`** – Tools and equations for analyzing electrical circuits, including Ohm's law, Kirchhoff's laws, and AC/DC circuit behavior.
- **`electrostatics.py`** – Formulas for Coulomb’s law, electric potential, capacitance, and charge distributions.
- **`magnetostatics.py`** – Functions for calculating magnetic fields, forces, and inductance under steady-state conditions.
- **`maxwell.py`** – Implementation of Maxwell’s equations in different forms, with utilities for solving field problems.
- **`optics.py`** – Models for reflection, refraction, diffraction, and lens/mirror systems.
- **`waves.py`** – Descriptions and calculations for electromagnetic wave propagation, interference, and polarization.
