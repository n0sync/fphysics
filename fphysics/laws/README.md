# Laws Module

This module provides a structured collection of fundamental physical laws and formulas across key domains of classical physics. It is designed for reference, education, and computational applications.

## Structure

### `__init__.py`
Initializes the laws package for import.

### `conservation.py`
Includes formulas and laws related to conservation principles such as conservation of energy, mass, momentum, and charge.

### `electromagnetic.py`
Contains core electromagnetic laws and associated formulas, including Gauss’s Law, Faraday’s Law, Ampère’s Law, and others.

### `momentum.py`
Provides momentum-related laws and equations — linear and angular momentum, impulse, and conservation in collisions.

### `newtons_laws.py`
Implements Newton's three laws of motion with corresponding force and acceleration formulas.

### `work_energy.py`
Covers the laws and equations related to work, kinetic and potential energy, mechanical power, and the work-energy principle.
