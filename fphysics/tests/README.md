# Tests

This module contains unit tests and validation routines for the physics library, ensuring correctness and consistency across mechanics, electromagnetism, quantum physics, thermodynamics, and mathematical tools.  

## Structure  

- **`__init__.py`**  
  Initializes the tests package for import.  

- **`test_mechanics`**  
  Tests classical mechanics modules, including Newton’s laws, energy conservation, and dynamics.  

- **`test_electromagnetism`**  
  Validates electromagnetism implementations such as Maxwell’s equations, fields, and potentials.  

- **`test_quantum`**  
  Tests quantum mechanics modules, covering operators, wavefunctions, and observables.  

- **`test_thermodynamics`**  
  Ensures correctness of thermodynamic relations, laws, and equations of state.  

- **`test_constants.py`**  
  Verifies physical constants used throughout the library for accuracy and consistency.  

- **`test_integration.py`**  
  Tests mathematical integration routines, numerical solvers, and symbolic checks where applicable.
