# Quantum Module

This module provides a collection of fundamental topics, methods, and models in quantum mechanics. It is designed for reference, learning, and computational exploration of quantum systems.  

## Structure  

- **`__init__.py`**  
  Initializes the quantum package for import.  

- **`harmonic_oscillator.py`**  
  Implements the quantum harmonic oscillator — energy eigenvalues, eigenfunctions, and ladder operator methods.  

- **`hydrogen_atom.py`**  
  Provides solutions for the hydrogen atom: radial wavefunctions, energy spectrum, and quantum numbers.  

- **`operators.py`**  
  Defines core quantum operators (momentum, position, angular momentum) and their algebra.  

- **`perturbation.py`**  
  Introduces time-independent and time-dependent perturbation theory.  

- **`spin.py`**  
  Covers spin systems, Pauli matrices, and spin measurement simulations.  

- **`statistics.py`**  
  Describes quantum statistics: Bose–Einstein, Fermi–Dirac, and Maxwell–Boltzmann distributions.  

- **`tunneling.py`**  
  Models quantum tunneling through barriers and transmission probabilities.  

- **`wave_functions.py`**  
  Provides wavefunctions for common quantum systems and methods for normalization, expectation values, and probability densities.
