Title: Solving the Depressed Cubic – Tartaglia’s Breakthrough

In the 16th century Niccolò Tartaglia discovered a general solution to the
depressed cubic

    x³ + p x = q.

His substitution x = u + v leads to the relations
    u v = −p/3   and   u³ + v³ = q,
from which one obtains the closed‑form root published later in Cardano’s *Ars Magna*:

        x = ∛(q/2 + Δ) + ∛(q/2 − Δ),
    where Δ = √((q/2)² + (p/3)³).

The other two roots follow by multiplying the cube‑roots by the complex cube
roots of unity.

    v = (q / 2 - Δ) ** (1 / 3)
    root = u + v

Title: The Copenhagen Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics

Initiated chiefly by Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg (1920s–1930s), the Copenhagen
interpretation holds that:

• The wavefunction |ψ⟩ encodes complete statistical knowledge of a system.
• Physical properties are not definite prior to measurement; they are *potentialities*.
• Measurement causes an irreversible, non‑unitary “collapse” of |ψ⟩ onto an eigenstate.
• Complementarity: mutually exclusive experimental arrangements reveal
  complementary aspects (e.g., particle vs. wave).
• Probabilities follow the Born rule: P(i) = |⟨ψ_i|ψ⟩|².
• Classical measuring devices are described by classical physics; quantum/classical
  cut is contextual but necessary.

Critics have objected to the vagueness of “collapse” and the role of the observer,
but Copenhagen remains one of the most widely taught viewpoints.

Title: The P vs NP Problem – A Million Dollar Mystery

One of the most famous unsolved problems in computer science and mathematics:

    Is P = NP?

Where:
• P  = problems solvable quickly (in polynomial time)
• NP = problems where solutions can be verified quickly

Key idea: If you can quickly *check* a solution, can you also *find* one quickly?

• NP-complete problems (e.g., SAT, Subset-Sum, Traveling Salesman) are the hardest in NP.
• A polynomial-time solution to any NP-complete problem implies P = NP.

This problem was formally posed by Stephen Cook in 1971 and remains unsolved.
It is one of the seven Millennium Prize Problems—solving it earns you **$1,000,000** from the Clay Mathematics Institute.

So far, no one knows the answer.

Title: Goldbach’s Conjectures – A Timeless Enigma in Number Theory

Proposed in 1742 by Christian Goldbach in correspondence with Euler, the conjectures are:

• **Strong Goldbach Conjecture**: Every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.
    → Example: 28 = 11 + 17

• **Weak Goldbach Conjecture**: Every odd integer greater than 5 is the sum of three primes.
    → Example: 29 = 7 + 11 + 11

Euler considered the strong version a special case of the weak one.
Though tested up to very large numbers, both remain unproven in general.

• The weak conjecture was **proven in 2013** by Harald Helfgott.
• The strong conjecture is still **open** — but no counterexample has ever been found.
