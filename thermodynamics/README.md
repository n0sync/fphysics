# Thermodynamics Module

This branch of the library provides formulas, principles, and computational tools for understanding thermodynamic systems and processes.

## Structure
- **heat_engines.py** – Models and efficiency calculations for different heat engines.
- **heat_transfer.py** – Conduction, convection, and radiation equations.
- **laws.py** – The four laws of thermodynamics with relevant formulas.
- **phase_transitions.py** – Analysis of melting, boiling, sublimation, and related processes.

Useful for physics simulations, engineering applications, and thermal system analysis.
